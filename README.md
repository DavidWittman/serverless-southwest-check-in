# Serverless Southwest Check In

[![Build Status](https://github.com/DavidWittman/serverless-southwest-check-in/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DavidWittman/serverless-southwest-check-in/actions)

Serverless Southwest Check In is an email bot which will automatically check you into your Southwest flights. Never sit in a middle seat again!

This project is powered by the AWS Serverless Platform (Lambda, Step Functions, and SES) and was inspired by similar projects from Aaron Ortbals and [Joe Beda](https://github.com/jbeda/southwest-checkin).

## Quickstart

## Installation

Skip to the [Deploy](#deploy) section if you already have Terraform installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

### Requirements

 - [Terraform 0.12+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html). Install this first.
 - AWS IAM user credentials with Administrator access (for Terraform)
 - A Route53 hosted zone for receiving emails via SES

### Configure your AWS Credentials

Add your credentials to your environment, with `aws configure`, or directly with Terraform.

Here's an example of setting your credentials via environment variables. For more detailed explanations, see the [Terraform AWS Provider documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/).

``` bash
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Initialize Terraform state

Run the following command to configure Terraform's [Remote State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html) in S3.

```
$ terraform init terraform/
```

You will be prompted for an S3 location to store the remote statefile in. If you wish to use a local state, just remove `terraform/backend.tf` and rerun this command.

## Usage

### Terraform Variables

You need to either specify your variables in a `terraform.tfvars` file, or you will be prompted for the variables during the deploy. 

You can rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` and edit it. Alternatively, you can skip to the [Deploy](#deploy) section below in which you will be prompted for the following variables:
* **var.admin_email**: Administrator email to receive confirmations and alerts. 
* **var.domains**: List of domains that already have a Route 53 hosted zone configured. The MX record for this domain name will be set to the SES SMTP receiver endpoints for your region, so choose a domain which you do not currently use to receive email. Must be formatted as a list. For example: `["domain.com"]`
* **var.recipients**: List of email addresses that can receive a forwarded check-in. Must be formatted as a list. For example: `["checkin@domain.com"]`
* **var.feedback_email**: An email address under one of the `domains` which receives user feedback. e.g. `feedback@example.com`. All mail sent to this address is directed to an SNS topic and not processed any further.
* **provider.aws.region**: AWS region in which to deploy

### Deploy

To package, build, and deploy to AWS, run:

``` bash
$ make deploy
```

Or, if you don't have make installed:

```
$ pip install -r lambda/requirements.txt -t lambda/vendor/python && terraform apply terraform/
```

### Add a flight

New flights can be added by an SES email trigger or by manually executing an AWS Step Function.

#### Add via Email

Forward your reservation email to the email address set above as `var.recipients`. The reservation email is sent by Southwest at purchase time and should be in the form:

```
Flight reservation (ABC123) | 25DEC17 | ABC-XYZ | LASTNAME/FIRSTNAME
```

#### Manually execute Step Function

Start an execution of the `sw-check-in` Step Function via the AWS cli, passing in your check-in details in JSON as input. Here's an example:

```
STEP_FN_INPUT='{
  "first_name": "George",
  "last_name": "Bush",
  "confirmation_number": "ABC123",
  "email": "gwb@example.com"
}'
STEP_FN_ARN=$(aws --output text stepfunctions list-state-machines --query 'stateMachines[*].stateMachineArn' | grep -E ':sw-check-in$')
aws stepfunctions start-execution \
  --state-machine-arn "$STEP_FN_ARN" \
  --input "$STEP_FN_INPUT"
```

The `email` parameter is optional and sets the email address to which notifications will be sent.

### Other

#### Notifications

An SNS topic `checkin-notifications` is created as part of the Terraform deploy, but you must manually create and attach a subscription to it through the SNS dashboard. See the Amazon documentation on how to [Subscribe to a Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html) for more information.

### Testing

To run tests, you must first have the requirements provided in `lambda/requirements-dev.txt` installed:

``` bash
$ pip install -r lambda/requirements-dev.txt
```

After you have installed the test dependencies, you can run the test suite with:

``` bash
# unit tests
$ make test
# flake8 style check
$ make lint
```
